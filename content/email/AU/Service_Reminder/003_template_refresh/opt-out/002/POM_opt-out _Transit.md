Also known as AdBlue速, this fluid helps reduce vehicle emissions.<br/><br/>It's important that you maintain AdBlue速 fluid. So, when your Transit begins to run low, you can purchase a new bottle from your local Ford dealer, selected petrol stations, and automotive retailers.<br/><br/>For more information, and guidance on how to refill your AdBlue速 levels, watch the video above or visit the <a href="https://www.ford.com.au/owners/service/ad-blue/#" style="text-decoration:underline; color:#2D96CD;" >Ford AdBlue速</a> website.<br/><br/>'''
