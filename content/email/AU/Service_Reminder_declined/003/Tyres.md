    When you last serviced your Ford <%${user.CustomAttribute['Model']}%> with us, our technician completed a Vehicle Report Card. Your tyres were flagged as yellow, meaning they may require replacement before your next scheduled service. <br /><br />
    We know you are not yet due for a scheduled service, however - if you would like your tyres checked for peace of mind in the interim, please call <%${user.CustomAttribute['Dealer_Name']}%> Ford on <%${user.CustomAttribute['Dealer_Phone']}%> to book an inspection.
