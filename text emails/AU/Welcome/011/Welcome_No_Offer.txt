But our job isn't done now that you're on the road. At Ford we like to look after our owners, so we provide our Service Guarantee for added peace-of-mind.

With Ford's Service Price Promise(1), you'll know what you're going to pay for a standard service before you go in. But the service doesn't stop there. You can get State Auto Club Roadside Assistance and Membership(2) for up to 7 years from Autoclub participating dealers. Ford also has a Free Loan Car program(3), so we can keep you on the road whilst your car is being serviced.
