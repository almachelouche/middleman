Featuring:

2.2L TDCi Diesel engine with 6-speed manual transmission 

Ford SYNC(R) connectivity system(1)

Cruise control 

Driver and front passenger airbags

All this and more is available to you now in the Ford Transit.

The service you'll love, guaranteed

We know that a new car is a big decision <%${user.CustomAttribute['FullName']}%>, so our job isn't done once you pick up your car.

With Ford's Service Price Promise(2) http://www.ford.com.au/owners/service/calculator , you'll know what you're going to pay for a standard service before you go in. But the service doesn't stop there. You can get State Auto Club Roadside Assistance and Membership(3) for up to 7 years from Autoclub participating dealers. Ford also has a Free Loan Car program(4), so we can keep you on the road whilst your car is being serviced. After all, that's what service should be.

So don't wait. Check out the latest offers on the Ford Transit today.
